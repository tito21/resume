In this repository you can find my resume and the style files used to create it.

To compile a pdf run `make pdf` and a web version with `make html`. It requires
pandoc and wkhtmltopdf. Running `make all` builds the resume in the formats
above plus .docx and plain text (markdown).

Things I would like to add:
   - A dark mode
   - ✅ A short description of myself and goals
   - Add side projects
   - ✅ Include thesis title
   - Make spanish version
