   - A dark mode
   - ✅ A short description of myself and goals
   - Add side projects
   - ✅ Include thesis title
   - Make Spanish version

# Building

Github actions should take care of building, an `.html`, `.pdf`, `.md` and `.docx` as ralease artifacts.

To force a reease follow this steps:
 1. Commit your changes
 2. Add a tag with `git tag "v{version-number}" main`
 3. Then push the tag to github `git push origin v{version-number}`

To build locally use `make`. To compile a pdf run `make pdf` and a web version with `make html`. It requires pandoc and
a chrome based browser. Running `make all` builds the resume in the formats above plus .docx and plain text (markdown).

<!-- The `.pdf` is generated by downloading and installing chromium as a snap. This is not ideal because it is slow. -->
