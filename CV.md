## Extracurricular activities

-   **Browser Extension UCaccess**, Developer
    -   Allows easy and legal access to scientific papers through the
        university’s proxy server.
    -   Code and extension: <https://github.com/tito21/UCaccess>
-   **Robotics**, Coach and Tutor 🤖️
    -   2016 - 2017 One week workshop for 12-13 year old kids. Each kid
        could build and program their own mobile robot using the Arduino
        platform. I have also taught a similar workshop using the LEGO
        Mindstorm platform.
    -   2015 - 2016 Coach of a FIST LEGO League (FLL) team. The FLL
        challenge is an international robotics competition where each
        team has to develop a robot that solves a number of tasks and do
        a scientific investigation. In 2015 the team won the “Values”
        national prize.
-   **Teleton Foundation**, Voluntary work
    -   Summer 2018, Santiago
    -   Help on the voluntaries’ office.
