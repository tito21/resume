## Extracurricular activities

- **Browser Extension UCaccess**, Developer
   + Allows easy and legal access to scientific papers through the
     university's proxy server.
   + Code and extension: <https://github.com/tito21/UCaccess>

- **Robotics**, Coach and Tutor 🤖️
   + 2016 - 2017 One week workshop for 12-13 year old kids. Each kid could
   build and program their own mobile robot using the Arduino platform. I have
   also taught a similar workshop using the LEGO Mindstorm platform.
  + 2015 - 2016 Coach of a FIST LEGO League (FLL) team. The FLL challenge is
  an international robotics competition where each team has to develop a
  robot that solves a number of tasks and do a scientific investigation. In
  2015 the team won the "Values" national prize.
